# Python game Save the Unicorn

I made this game during a workshop weekend at my university. Feel free to play it yourself!

The story is in Czech, here is its translation in case you are an English speaker:
You are being represented by a unicorn, who wants to study and so he decides on the Unicorn University(a real university in Prague). Your task is to fly through all of the semesters and of course, manage to collect all 210 credits (hidden in balloons) to be awarded a bachelor's degree. On your way, you have to deal with lightning which you shouldn't touch or you will die (if touched more than 3 times).

This game was created as a satire for other students and teachers of Unicorn University, as well as its purpose was to gain a good mark in the subject of Python.

Basics:
Use WASD for movement, space for skip, and R for restart.
